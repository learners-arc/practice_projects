# Form Validation

This repository contains a project focused on form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates how to validate user inputs in a form and ensure the data meets specific requirements before submission.

## Features
- Validation for various input types: text, email, password, and more.
- Real-time error messages for invalid inputs.
- User-friendly design with clear feedback on input errors.
- Responsive layout for better accessibility on different devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the form.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and enhancing the user experience.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the validation logic.

## Installation
To use or modify this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/learners-arc/practice_projects
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd practice_projects/HTML_CSS_JS/Form-validation
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to view the form.

## How It Works
1. The user fills out the form fields.
2. JavaScript checks the input values against defined validation rules.
3. If any input is invalid:
   - An error message is displayed below the respective field.
   - The user must correct the input before submitting the form.
4. If all inputs are valid:
   - The form can be successfully submitted.




## Future Enhancements
- Add server-side validation for enhanced security.
- Implement additional validation rules for complex input types.
- Include animations for error messages to improve user experience.
